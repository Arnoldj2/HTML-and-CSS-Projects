	<h2> HTML Entities - written without shadow text </h2>
	
	<p> Character entites are used to display reserved characters in HTML </p>
	<p> One example is the less than symbol " &lt; " , normally this would be 
	recognized as a tag however using entities names or numbers allows the actual character itself to be displayed</p>
